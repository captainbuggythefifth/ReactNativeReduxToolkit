# React Native Typescript + Redux Toolkit + Translation + Theme

This jump start project is made with ❤️ 😍 💕. Nah, kidding. [React Native Typescript](https://reactnative.dev/) + [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) + [Translation](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-native-localize-how-to-build-multi-lang-app-b8604884baca) Hooks with [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage) + Theme Hooks with AsyncStorage following [Atomic Design Pattern](https://codeburst.io/atomic-design-with-react-e7aea8152957). Of course, everything is tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Native Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro) 👌 💯 👀
